Here's a more concise version for GitHub:
# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix's catalog using Python, providing insights into content categories, genre distributions, release trends, and more.

## Overview

Key questions answered in this analysis:
- Which content types (Movies vs. TV Shows) are most common?
- What are the top genres and countries for content production?
- How have Netflix releases evolved over time?
- Which months see the highest release frequencies?
- Who are the most prolific directors on Netflix?

## Dataset

Columns analyzed include:
- **Category**: Movie or TV Show
- **Title**: Name of the content
- **Director**, **Cast**, **Country**
- **Release_Date**, **Rating**, **Duration**
- **Type**: Genre
- **Description**

## Analysis

Visualizations include:
1. **Category Distribution**: Movies vs. TV Shows
2. **Top 10 Genres** and **Content-Producing Countries**
3. **Releases Over Time**: Yearly and monthly trends
4. **Rating Distribution**
5. **Top Directors by Number of Titles**

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Future Work

Potential extensions include analyzing viewership trends, sentiment analysis on descriptions, and recommendation modeling.
